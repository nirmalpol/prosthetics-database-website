# ProstheticsDatabase

https://terminaldevicedatabaseapp.herokuapp.com/

Project Idea:
- Provide website with open source 3D prosthetic files for different recreational activities that can be uploaded and downloaded for prosthetic users without having to pay large sums for high end prosthetics.

Software Bugs/Defects:
- Unable to rotate/pan files in Safari but can zoom in and out; updates correctly; download correctly
- On Windows, view slightly shifts based on whether a side scrollbar is present or not


Others:
- Users may be confused that canvas does not update unless ‘Submit’ is explicitly pressed again 
- Users may like to directly change certain dimensions of the file for their needs
